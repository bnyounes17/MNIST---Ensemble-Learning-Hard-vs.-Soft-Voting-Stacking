# MNIST---Ensemble-Learning-Hard-vs.-Soft-Voting-Stacking
We applied an Ensemble Learning to the MNIST dataset using the classifiers:  
- Random Forest Classifier  
- Extra Trees Classifier  
- Support Vector Machine classifier: LinearSVC  
- Neural Network Classifier (Multi-layer Perceptron): MLPClassifier

We compared single classifiers with results from hard voting and single voting.  

Then, we train a blender and predict with a stacking ensemble that we compare with previous voting and classifiers results.
